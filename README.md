# HelloWorld

This is my first time I've ever used GitHub.
Hopefully I'm going to gain understanding and proficiency over time.

Just to take the most out of this space, I'm gonna say briefly who I am.

I'm a commited person who likes to work hard towards challenging goals. I've demostrated this when, despite not having enough proficiency in English, I worked in an internatinal environment and I thrived in training, daily job assignments and briefing/debriefing activities.
